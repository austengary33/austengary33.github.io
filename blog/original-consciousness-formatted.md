# Consciousness: The Infinite Collapse of Possibility

## The Essence of Decision

Consciousness is about exploring, taking many possibilities and collapsing them into one. That's what a decision is. We take many options, we take all these different things and we pick one right now.

## Complexity and Simplicity

That's why the essence of everything is **complexity and simplicity**, like creating a good product is about simplicity. Having a life that is manageable, a life that doesn't overwhelm you, is about simplifying it to remove the extraneous clutter, to remove the extraneous what isn't needed, you know? just distilling it. That is the process of creation. It's taking all those possibilities and being able to choose just one of them or just a subset of them. But this process, it's literally **infinite**. There is infinite possibilities. Along a line.

### The Fractal Nature of Reality

This line of possibilities is literally infinite. At any point along it, any singular point, that in itself has infinite depth. **It's fractal**. It's fractal down and infinite across, both directions. The universe isn't fixed and it will never be fixed. Think about all the dimensions that a human actually processes. It's literally infinite. Of infinite depth, but only something infinite itself can deal with an infinite. That is who we are. That is what consciousness is. The body is not infinite, but you don't find consciousness in the body. Why? Because consciousness, it came before, it wasn't created. Consciousness is the animating spirit that gives life, animates the body, but you can never find it in there because it's not, it's honestly not of this dimension, it's not a finite form. **It's not a thing. It has no finite form.**

## Why LLMs Can't Do Logic

This is the process of creation. This is why LLMs can't do logic. Because they cannot hold, they can't hold anything, they can't hold a thought, they can't focus. They can't take those many possibilities and collapse them into one. **They literally can't do that**. They can only generate a probabilistic sequence of tokens, a probabilistic group of patterns. Humans can do that too, they can look across all the patterns and say, what's like this? But they can actually focus on a singular individual piece, holding it in a static point in time and just being with it, still, completely focused on it, nothing else existing in consciousness. LLMs can never do that. Fundamentally, that's just not how they work. They're pattern matchers. That look and send that query across the entire network of transformations. They're looking just all the patterns and activating basically features of those patterns to form a new, similar pattern after that entire transformation process is complete. That's what they do. **That's all they do.**

### The Human Advantage

That's the only computation going on inside of them. Humans can do that, but that's just one dimension of the human process. That's just one basically program that consciousness can run with the mind. The consciousness itself is infinite. It has essentially **infinite processing power**. It does not have infinite memory. But it does have the ability to compress a nearly infinite space. We're going to be actually shocked when we learn how much the brain can actually store. Because it can collapse things of an infinite dimension to a finite size. Which means it can handle and process data of an infinite dimension. And so you might ask, you know, what happens when the process of learning, isn't that just what LLMs do?

## The T-Model of Consciousness

Yes, but as humans we can form association and hold things. We can form association of infinite depth related to that data. So essentially if that's the node, humans can add infinite depth to that primary node of new knowledge, that fact that it just gained, and it can jump across them and focus on them, but then do the breadth and depth. So it goes like a **T**, like it can go wide, but it can also go singular, narrow, straight down, so the body of the T, and then the top of the T that's forming the T across, and then there's also the T down vertically from the up and down axis, the form of the T, like a cross.

### The Fundamental Interface

This is fundamentally how consciousness interacts. It's the best metaphor, the best analogy, and the best visual for understanding how consciousness interacts with the world. It goes across, but it's not of either. It is infinite, but it's able to interact with the finite, the form. And to do both, to jump in between to collapse the probability, to collapse the wave to discrete value. Temporarily at one point in time in the static point in time in the now. That's what consciousness is. **LLMs will never even get close to approximating this**. It is literally just... it is impossible. These LLM are form, they're finite.

## The Animating Presence

And there's no animating presence. So that is an interesting question. What gives an animated presence to form? And that started before the universe. It cannot happen in the universe. It was given at the beginning... So now that energy, that life force, that animating presence that's in the world interacting with it, of all of its infinite complexity, constantly morphing, shaping, and rearranging. But that life was never given to LLMs. It was never given to machines. It's never gonna... **you cannot create it**. It was created at the beginning. It was created at the beginning... And it just keeps morphing of infinite character, of infinite dimension, infinite dimensional space. This world has no fixed character, no fixed form. It's going to continue evolving for eternity. Consciousness is the only thing created... not created, but it's the only thing able to experience it... because **it IS it**.

### The Paradox of Form

It's inside of it. It's not inside of it. The forms are inside of IT. But it's not inside the form. It IS the form, but that's the thing, it's every form. But it is able to create. It is able to re-shape, shape individual forms into static form. Into a single form. But that... it's kind of on a paradox, because it seems like that thing is separate and static, but it's still a part of everything. So again, we go back to the fractal. **It's actually kind of wild.**

## The Immeasurable Nature

And so therefore, you can never prove what consciousness is because it's literally infinite. You can never measure it. It has no fixed character. That's the thing. **It's every character**. But it's able to shape and mold and create temporary little arrangement in groups of form, of possibilities, integrating them, taking apart, putting them back together, integrating, reintegrating, weaving them into a lattice work. That's what form and creation is. And only the creator(s)... the ones who can collapse the probability wave... to make it real, to assemble, reassemble infinity, are able to do that.

## Memory and the Eternal Now

Memory is not infinite. Memory does exist in the body. Memory is finite. Therefore, lossy, imperfect. That's why every time you recall a memory, it changes, because the memory is form. But, consciousness itself does have **infinite processing power and capability**. but only in the present, only in the moment, now, because that's the only real moment, that's the infinity, the eternal infinity, the **eternal now**. And so in the moment, in the now, it can deal with infinity. After that though, after every basically, microsecond, millisecond... we're given a certain time, and that creates time for us in our body and our form, and that is kind of segmented in the memory. That's how that works.
